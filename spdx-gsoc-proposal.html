          <h3> If you're thinking about writing a proposal for Google Summer of Code projects, you might be uncertain about a few things. How big of a task should you propose? What should you include in your proposal? How to communicate your projects end goal? How can you make it more acceptable? Of course, you will have to decide the answers to these questions with your own judgement, but this page lists out some of the common questions you should include in your proposal. At the end, there are some suggestions that may give you inspiration. </h3>



  <h2>Application template</h2>



<h3 id="header-3">You are encouraged to be as creative as you want to be. Your proposal should be as technically specific as possible to be understood by some expert in the domain and as simpler to be read by programmer in some other domain. Basically, include all relevant details for the project idea your are proposing. To help us identify you as a good candidate, below are some questions you should answer at the end of your proposal. If you have already included some of these answers in your proposal, include them here also. </h3>
