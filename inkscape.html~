          <h2> When did you first hear about Inkscape?
I first heard about inkscape when my friend used it to make an SVG image for a club project he was working on.

What kind of drawings do you create with Inkscape?
I have tried inkscape for creating simple shapes like figure. Not an artwork though.

Describe your participation in our community (e.g. uploaded drawings, tutorials, bug reports, communication via mailing lists or IRC).
I have fixed some bugs on the inkscape website. Apart from that, I have contacted the web admin whenever necessary or in doubt over mailing list and IRC.

Describe your contributions to the Inkscape development (e.g. bug fixes, translations, packaging, testing).
I have added jquery validation in the resource form of the inkscape-web repository. Now the data,size of the image and link is validated on the front end instead of the previous back end validation for a trouble free experience for the user. If they chose a much bigger file than their limit or forgot to fill some required fields, a suitable error will be displayed to the user near the error field.

In exactly two sentences, why should we pick YOU?
Well, I have all of the skills and experience that is needed for this project. I am reliable and have complete dedication and passion about my work, my responsibilities are my first priorities.

What is your name, email address, and irc nickname?
Name: Rohit Lodha
Personal Email: rohit.lodhartg@gmail.com
University Email: f2015040@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in
Freenode irc: rtgdk_ or rohitrtg( when i use freenode through mobile)

Describe any plans you have for the summer in addition to GSoC (classes, thesis, job, vacation, etc.).
Our college provide a practice school internship for sophomores where they are placed in any organisation( research institute,startup,NGOs, etc.) across India during the summer . So, I will have my internship during the 2 month period(June-July) but I am sure that it will not have any effect on my work and will manage my time accordingly.

What programming projects have you completed?

Django

I have made the college SSMS website managing different grubs signing of     students( grub is basically an event where an Indian state's food is served by different state association in the campus) 
Website: http://ssms-pilani.org/ 
Github: https://github.com/rtgdk/ssms/     
I have worked on many other website when I worked with Enable Live- a startup     providing Web and App Solutions.
 https://github.com/rtgdk/arvdrs     https://github.com/rtgdk/bhopal_incinerators         
In the early stage of learning Django, I made a simple to use website for my friends where they can upload and download photos from a simple platform rather than sending it every other person.

Java
I have made a project(UML Sequence Diagram) to generate test cases from pseudo code     and calculating hazard states based on those sequences under the     guidance of my Professor.    
https://github.com/rtgdk/UML-Sequence-Diagrams         
Android
Me and my friends developed an app for the blind people to see through their smartphones when we participated in code.fun.do , a hackthon organised by Microsoft.
https://github.com/rtgdk/VizAid

What are your favorite programming tools (editor, etc.)?
Editor: While working in Linux, I mainly use Sublime and Gedit.
On windows, I use notepad++
Compiler: gcc/terminal on linux, eclipse/IDLE on windows

Describe any work on other open-source projects.
I have worked on Bugheist and hackademic project from OWASP some time back. Bugheist is a tool for reporting bugs/issues and getting points for that. Hackademic deals with web application security.
Apart from that, I have recently worked with SPDX fixing some bugs. SPDX is a software license format.

List other GSoC projects you are applying to.
I would be applying to SPDX apart from inkscape.


Project Task: Developing a portal for unifying project,ideas,bugs and tasks to manage them
efficiently

Abstract: Providing an easy all-in-one website to upload and view different ideas,bugs,project
and tasks with the features of assigning, marking, grouping them under a category
for easy access and search.

Description:
1. A portal for registering new developers/contributors to upload bugs,report issues and
suggest ideas for development
2. The user can upload bugs,issues,ideas through the portal with the feature of marking
it as funded /non funded, grouping them by tags, assigning it to some other user.
3. Another user can view the project he/she may want to work on by searching with filters
4. A comment section where the contributors can let the user know that they are currently working on that project. A way for them to ask query regarding the issues.
5. Some of the main features of blueprint launchpad will be implemented.
6. A separate page where Janitorials tasks can be uploaded( Like fixing headers,
footers, documentation etc. which can be done by anybody. ) User can update their status of
fixing anything like that.
7. The home page will show all the recent bugs/issues/ideas submitted.



Work Plan

Post-application Period and Community Bonding Period:
Diving into inkscape documentations to improve my knowledge of working of     inkscape to build a better design specific to the needs of the organisation.
Working with the mentors as well as other community people to decide a UI design     for a quick start.[Phase-1]
Browsing through the types of bugs and issues currently on gitlab and launchpad
for a better view of what kinds of fields database may need.

Development Phase:

Phase-1 : Deciding a design modal to use for storing and accessing different kinds of data efficiently
Phase-2 : Implementing the above features.
Phase-3 : Writing Tests for code validity and testing them.
Phase-4 : A total review by the community to let me know of any issues or improvement and working on them,
Phase-5 : Integrating it with Inkscape and documenting the code for easy future use.

Tentative Work Period(Timeline):

Week 1( May 30 - June 6) [Development Phase-1]: Creating a basic model of what is needed, how it is needed and where it is needed
Basically working on the initial structure of the database, linking them together.
Week 2-3(June 7 - June 20) [Development Phase-2]: Start working on developing a user interface for registering and uploading of idea/project/tasks by a user. Giving a way for the user to edit them back.,assign them, mark them as funded or non funded, and if funded then by whom.
Week 4-5 (June 20 - July 2) [Development Phase-2]: Adding implementation for user to view other projects based on different filters and work on them by letting other users know.
Week 6-7(July 3 - July 16) [Development Phase-3] : Writing some basic tests to test the implementation
Week 8: (July 17 - July 23) [Development Phase-4]: Review by mentors as well as other community members to improve/fix the portal. They will given access to the portal for testing.
Week 9-10(July 23 - August 6) [Development Phase-4]: Fixing remaining bugs and improving UI to make the portal more flexible, usable and popular among people. Improvements according to the reviews.
Week 11:(August 7-August 13) [Development Phase-5] : Adding remaining documentation for future use
Week 12:(August 13-August 21) [Development Phase-5] : Integrating it with inkscape

Week 13-14(August 21 â€“ September 5): Working with the community to transfer bugs from launchpad and gitlab.

An easy to use all-in-one development project management system is ready.

Future implementation
We can auto-update the website showing the commits made by the user related to that task on gitlab.
